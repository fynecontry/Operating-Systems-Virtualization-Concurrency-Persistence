# Summary

We have introduced the basic ideas behind scheduling and developed two families of approaches:

- The first runs the shortest job remaining and thus optimizes turnaround time; 
- The second alternates between all jobs and thus optimizes response time. 

Both are bad where the other is good, alas, an inherent trade-off common in systems. 
We have also seen how we might incorporate I/O into the picture, but have still not solved the problemâ€‹ of the fundamental inability of the OS to see into the future. 
Shortly, we will see how to overcome this problem, by building a scheduler that uses the recent past to predict the future. 
This scheduler is known as the **multi-level feedback queue**.

## Simulator
Using the provided [scheduler.py](https://github.com/fynecontry/Operating-Systems-Virtualization-Concurrency-Persistence/blob/main/virtualization/cpu_scheduling/scheduler.py) answer the following questions.

#### 1. Compute the response time and turnaround time when running three jobs of length 200 with the `SJF` and `FIFO` schedulers.
```
root@educative:/usr/local/educative/code/HW-Scheduler# ./scheduler.py -p SJF -j 3 -m 200 -c
ARG policy SJF
ARG jobs 3
ARG maxlen 200
ARG seed 0

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job: 
  Job 0 ( length = 169 )
  Job 1 ( length = 152 )
  Job 2 ( length = 85 )


** Solutions **

Execution trace:
  [ time   0 ] Run job 2 for 85.00 secs ( DONE at 85.00 )
  [ time  85 ] Run job 1 for 152.00 secs ( DONE at 237.00 )
  [ time 237 ] Run job 0 for 169.00 secs ( DONE at 406.00 )

Final statistics:
  Job   2 -- Response: 0.00  Turnaround 85.00  Wait 0.00
  Job   1 -- Response: 85.00  Turnaround 237.00  Wait 85.00
  Job   0 -- Response: 237.00  Turnaround 406.00  Wait 237.00

  Average -- Response: 107.33  Turnaround 242.67  Wait 107.33

root@educative:/usr/local/educative/code/HW-Scheduler# ./scheduler.py -p FIFO -j 3 -m 200 -c
ARG policy FIFO
ARG jobs 3
ARG maxlen 200
ARG seed 0

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job: 
  Job 0 ( length = 169 )
  Job 1 ( length = 152 )
  Job 2 ( length = 85 )


** Solutions **

Execution trace:
  [ time   0 ] Run job 0 for 169.00 secs ( DONE at 169.00 )
  [ time 169 ] Run job 1 for 152.00 secs ( DONE at 321.00 )
  [ time 321 ] Run job 2 for 85.00 secs ( DONE at 406.00 )

Final statistics:
  Job   0 -- Response: 0.00  Turnaround 169.00  Wait 0.00
  Job   1 -- Response: 169.00  Turnaround 321.00  Wait 169.00
  Job   2 -- Response: 321.00  Turnaround 406.00  Wait 321.00

  Average -- Response: 163.33  Turnaround 298.67  Wait 163.33
```


#### 2. Now do the same but with jobs of different lengths: 100, 200, and 300.

```
root@educative:/usr/local/educative/code/HW-Scheduler# ./scheduler.py -p SJF -l 100,200,300 -c
ARG policy SJF
ARG jlist 100,200,300

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job: 
  Job 0 ( length = 100.0 )
  Job 1 ( length = 200.0 )
  Job 2 ( length = 300.0 )


** Solutions **

Execution trace:
  [ time   0 ] Run job 0 for 100.00 secs ( DONE at 100.00 )
  [ time 100 ] Run job 1 for 200.00 secs ( DONE at 300.00 )
  [ time 300 ] Run job 2 for 300.00 secs ( DONE at 600.00 )

Final statistics:
  Job   0 -- Response: 0.00  Turnaround 100.00  Wait 0.00
  Job   1 -- Response: 100.00  Turnaround 300.00  Wait 100.00
  Job   2 -- Response: 300.00  Turnaround 600.00  Wait 300.00

  Average -- Response: 133.33  Turnaround 333.33  Wait 133.33
```

#### 3. Now do the same, but also with the RR scheduler and a time-slice of 1.
```
root@educative:/usr/local/educative/code/HW-Scheduler# ./scheduler.py -p RR -j 3 -m 200 -q 1 -c
ARG policy RR
ARG jobs 3
ARG maxlen 200
ARG seed 0

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job: 
  Job 0 ( length = 169 )
  Job 1 ( length = 152 )
  Job 2 ( length = 85 )


** Solutions **

#### 4. For what types of workloads does SJF deliver the same turnaround times as FIFO?
> Workloads which arrive in ascending order will have the same turnaround times using SJF or FIFO, as well as workloads of equal lengths

#### 5. For what types of workloads and quantum lengths does SJF deliver the same response times as RR?
> This is achieveable if quantum length is **always** equal to the shortest job in the queue and the length of all workloads are known in advance so the shortest job runs first.

#### 6. What happens to response time with SJF as job lengths increase? Can you use the simulator to demonstrate the trend?
```
root@educative:/usr/local/educative/code/HW-Scheduler# ./scheduler.py -p SJF -l 100,200,300,400 -c
ARG policy SJF
ARG jlist 100,200,300,400

Here is the job list, with the run time of each job: 
  Job 0 ( length = 100.0 )
  Job 1 ( length = 200.0 )
  Job 2 ( length = 300.0 )
  Job 3 ( length = 400.0 )

```

#### 7. What happens to response time with RR as quantum lengths increase? Can you write an equation that gives the worst-case response time, given N jobs?
> Response time increases as quantum lengths increase in RR algorithm. `worst-case response time = (N-1) * quantum_length`
