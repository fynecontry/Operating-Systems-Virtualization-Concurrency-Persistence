# Key Process Terms
The process is the major OS abstraction of a running program. At any point in time, the process can be described by its state: the contents of memory in its address space, the contents of CPU registers (including the program counter and stack pointer, among others), and information about I/O (such as open files which can be read or written).

The process API consists of calls that programs can make related to processes. Typically, this includes creation, destruction, and other useful calls.

Processes exist in one of many different process states, including running, ready to run, and blocked. Different events (e.g., getting scheduled or descheduled, or waiting for an I/O to complete) transition a process from one of these states to the other.
A process list contains information about all processes in the system. Each entry is found in what is sometimes called a `process control block (PCB)`, which is really just a structure that contains information about a specific process.

# Questions

- Run `process-run.py with` the following flags: `-l 5:100,5:100.` What should the CPU utilization be (e.g., the percent of time the CPU is in use?)
  ```
  # ./process-run.py -l 5:100,5:100 -cp
  Time     PID: 0     PID: 1        CPU        IOs 
    1     RUN:cpu      READY          1            
    2     RUN:cpu      READY          1            
    3     RUN:cpu      READY          1            
    4     RUN:cpu      READY          1

  ```
  
- Now run with these flags: ./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0. These flags specify one process with 4 instructions (all to use the CPU), and one that simply issues an I/O and waits for it to be done. How long does it take to complete both processes?
  ```
  # ./process-run.py -l 4:100,1:0 -cp
  Time     PID: 0     PID: 1        CPU        IOs

- Switch the order of the processes: `-l 1:0,4:100`. What happens now? Does switching the order matter? Why?
  ```
  # ./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -cp
  Time     PID: 0     PID: 1        CPU        IOs 
    1      RUN:io      READY          1            
    2     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1 
    3     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1 
    4     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1 
    5     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1 
    6*       DONE       DONE

  ```
  
 - We’ll now explore some of the other flags. One important flag is `-S`, which determines how the system reacts when a process issues an I/O. With the flag set to `SWITCH_ON_END`, the system will NOT switch to another process while one is doing I/O, instead of waiting until the process is completely finished. What happens when you run the following two processes (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END`), one doing I/O and the other doing CPU work?
   ```
     # ./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_END -p
    Time     PID: 0     PID: 1        CPU        IOs 
      1      RUN:io      READY          1            
      2     WAITING      READY                     1 
      3     WAITING      READY                     1 
      4     WAITING      READY                     1 
      5     WAITING      READY                     1

      8        DONE    RUN:cpu          1

    Stats: IO Busy  4 (44.44%)
    ```
- Now, run the same processes, but with the switching behavior set to switch to another process whenever one is `WAITING` for I/O (`-l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO`).
  ```
    # ./process-run.py -l 1:0,4:100 -c -S SWITCH_ON_IO -p
    Time     PID: 0     PID: 1        CPU        IOs 
      1      RUN:io      READY          1            
      2     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1 
      3     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1 
      4     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1 
      5     WAITING    RUN:cpu          1          1 
      6*       DONE       DONE                       

    Stats: Total Time 6
    Stats: CPU Busy 5 (83.33%)
    Stats: IO Busy  4 (66.67%)
  ```
 
- One other important behavior is what to do when an I/O completes. With `-I IO_RUN_LATER`, when an I/O completes, the process that issued it does not necessarily run right away; rather, whatever was running at the time keeps running. What happens when you run this combination of processes? (Run `./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_LATER -c -p`) Are system resources being effectively utilized?
  ```
  # ./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_LATER -cp
  Time     PID: 0     PID: 1     PID: 2     PID: 3        CPU        IOs

- Now run the same processes, but with `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` set, which immediately runs the process that issued the I/O. How does this behavior differ? Why might running a process that just completed an I/O again be a good idea?
  ```
  # ./process-run.py -l 3:0,5:100,5:100,5:100 -S SWITCH_ON_IO -I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE -cp

- Now run with some randomly generated processes: `-s 1 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 2 -l 3:50,3:50` or `-s 3 -l 3:50,3:50`. See if you can predict how the trace will turn out. What happens when you use the flag `-I IO_RUN_IMMEDIATE` vs. `-I_IO RUN_LATER`? What happens when you use `-S SWITCH_ON_IO` vs.`-S SWITCH_ON_END`?
