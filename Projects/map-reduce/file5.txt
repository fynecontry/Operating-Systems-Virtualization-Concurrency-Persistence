The ancient forest is a sanctuary of greenery and life. Tall trees form a canopy, creating a dappled pattern of light and shadow on the forest floor. Birds sing in harmonious melodies, creating a wonderful feeling and small creatures scurry among the leaves. Moss-covered rocks and fallen logs add to the enchanting scenery, inviting explorers to discover the secrets hidden within the woods.
